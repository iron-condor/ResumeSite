# ResumeSite

I created this project to have a personal website that I could use for jobhunting. It contains information about my career, skills and a copy of my resume. It is hosted at [chriswantsajob.com](https://www.chriswantsajob.com)

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
